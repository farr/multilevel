A simple example of multi-level modeling, trying to analyze student
scores by teacher.  See [the GitHub
pages](http://farr.github.com/multilevel) for code documentation and
an explanation of the multilevel model.  A transcript of a session
using emcee to analyze the synthetic data in students.dat.gz is in
transcript.py.
